# Array Explorer

When I was first learning array methods, I spent a lot of time digging through the docs to find the appropriate one, and I had to search one by one. I made this resource to help people find the correct array method a bit more naturally. You can narrow down what you want to do and explore until you find what's most useful to you.

Check out the site here: [https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/](https://sdras.github.io/array-explorer/)

Or if you prefer codepen: [https://codepen.io/sdras/full/gogVRX/](https://codepen.io/sdras/full/gogVRX/)

I realize that there are about a million ways that this resource can be set up, and some of the taxonomy is necessarily opionionated. I tried to focus on what I thought would have helped me learn the best, rather than industry standard delineations (mutator, accessor, iteration, for example). There are a lot of resources that already divide the methods this way, so if that style of learning suits you better, that's great! This resource is not set up that way.

I based most of the examples and longer descriptions off of the MDN documentation, altering it slightly where I felt the description was not as beginner-friendly as it could be.

**Enjoy!**

I'm going to start working on one for Object now, but I've heard people say they want to fork this project for other languages and data types (ruby, etc), please feel free to! If you let me know about it, I'll link it up here.

Many thanks to everyone who helped with the translations! @AWolf81, @Gonzalo2310, @welll, @julienmartin, @g-plane, @imbyurhan, @bahe007, @salahaa1, @proYang

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# to build for the docs:
npm run build
# then rename `dist` to `docs` and remove the first slash `/static` from `static` in `index.html`
# then change the font paths in the css file from `/static` to `../../static`
```
