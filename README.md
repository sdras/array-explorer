# JavaScript Array Explorer

When I was first learning array methods, I spent a lot of time digging through the docs to find the appropriate one, and I had to search one by one. I made this resource to help people find the correct array method a bit more naturally. You can narrow down what you want to do and explore until you find what's most useful to you.

Check out the site here: [https://arrayexplorer.netlify.com/](https://arrayexplorer.netlify.com/)

Or if you prefer codepen: [https://codepen.io/sdras/full/gogVRX/](https://codepen.io/sdras/full/gogVRX/)

I realize that there are about a million ways that this resource can be set up, and some of the taxonomy is necessarily opionionated. I tried to focus on what I thought would have helped me learn the best, rather than industry standard delineations (mutator, accessor, iteration, for example). There are a lot of resources that already divide the methods this way, so if that style of learning suits you better, that's great! This resource is not set up that way. Please keep in mind that this is not meant to be as comprehensive or a replacement for full documentation, which is why the MDN docs are linked to in each method.

I based most of the examples and longer descriptions off of the MDN documentation, altering it slightly where I felt the description was not as beginner-friendly as it could be.

**Enjoy!**
